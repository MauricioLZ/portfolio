                <p>Born in Brazil I studied Game Development at Unisinos in Porto Alegre. My good grades granted me the opportunity of a 1 year scholarship for an exchange in Computer Science in Canada at Wilfrid Laurier in 2015. Since then I lived and worked in Brazil, France and Ireland, where I am based now.
                    <br/><br/>I am quite adaptive and open to new experiences and I enjoy learning new skills and having challenges along the way. What may put me off in a challenge though is if it comes accompanied with too much pressure.
                    <br/><br/><br/>If you know what INFJ means than you may already know a good deal about me. Of course I donâ€™t match everything INFJ, but many things are surprisingly accurate for me.
                    <br/><br/>My game tag is usually Demirus and I frequently use Lelouch from Code Geass as my avatar image.</p>
