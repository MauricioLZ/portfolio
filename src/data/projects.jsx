        description: "Rush Hour was a game I developed in about 4 months when I had an internship with Industry Corporation in Canada. This was a project in almost total autonomy, since the company was starting to abandon game development at the time.\n\nThe UI is not the nicest, but at least I can say I modeled it in Blender.Most of the assets for the game were from a package purchased from Unityâ€™s asset store."
